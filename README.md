# Gridster - React Flux Demo

## Instructions

Try to connect the start and end blocks that are coloured green.

You can input any value for either columns or rows in the grid. The default is 10 x 10.

To generate the grid, hit the generate button.

Starting from the left try to connect the start and end cells by clicking or touching on adjacent horizontal or vertical cells.

## Todo
1. Styling around states of buttons
2. Bug when clicking on connected cell that is not next to start or end cell
